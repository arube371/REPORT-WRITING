Purpose of Report Writing
The primary purpose of report writing is to:
Inform: Present factual information and data.
Analyze: Examine and interpret data to conclude.
Recommend: Offer suggestions based on the analysis.
Document: Record progress, events, or results for future reference.
Reports are valuable tools for decision-making problem-solving and documenting important information.
They are used to communicate complex information in a structured and easily understandable format.
Tips of writing reports;
Use clear and simple language and Write in the third person
Key Components of Report Writing
Title: Indicates the topic of the report.
 Abstract: A brief summary of the report’s main points.
 Appendix: Supplementary material added at the end of a report.

Types of Reports
1. Informational Reports. 
An information report (also known as an expository or factual report) is a non-fiction text written to present facts and details about a specific subject, topic, event, or phenomenon. Its primary purpose is to inform the reader, not to persuade or entertain. It should be objective, well-researched, and logically structured.
A typical information report follows this standard structure:
1. Title
Purpose: Clearly states the topic of the report.
Characteristics: Should be concise, informative, and engaging.
2. Introduction
Purpose: Introduces the topic and provides context. Briefly defines or categorizes the subject (e.g., "The Giant Panda is a bear native to south-central China.
3. Body Paragraphs (Description)
•	Purpose: Presents the detailed information and facts about the topic. This is the main part of the report. Each paragraph should focus on a distinct aspect or sub-topic (e.g., Habitat, Diet, Appearance, Life Cycle, and History).
4. Conclusion
•	Purpose: Summarizes the main points and provides a sense of closure. Briefly restates the key information presented. Can offer a final observation, significance of the topic, or a brief interesting fact, without introducing new concepts.

3. Research reports (Brenda)
A research report is a systematic and well organized presentation of research findings that explains why research was done, how it was carried out, what was found and what the findings mean. Purpose of research reports. To communicate research findings systematically and clearly. To show evidence supporting or rejecting an idea. To help solve a problem. To share knowledge with other researchers. A sample of an Agricultural Report. Uganda Christian University Faculty of Agricultural Science Course Unit: Agronomy and Ecology Report Title: The Effects of organic and inorganic fertilizers on Maize growth. Student Name: Nabiryo Brenda Reg No: S25B26/043 Date of submission: 27th October 2025 2. Introduction Maize is one of the most important cereal crops grown in Uganda and serves as a major source of food and income for many households. However, its productivity is often limited by declining soil fertility due to continuous cultivation and inadequate fertilizer use. Fertilizers play a key role in improving soil fertility and increasing crop yields. Organic fertilizers, e.g., cow dung, improve nutrients slowly but improve soil structure, unlike these of inorganic fertilizers that release nutrients quickly but may degrade soil quality over time. This experiment was conducted to compare the effects of organic and inorganic fertilizers on maize growth under field conditions.

Discussion: Interpretation of results, implications, and recommendations. 5. Conclusion: Summary of key findings and implications. Example of a Technical Report: Title: Evaluation of Soil Fertility in a Maize Field Introduction: This report evaluates the soil fertility of a maize field in Uganda. The purpose is to determine the nutrient levels and pH of the soil to inform fertilizer application decisions. Methodology: Soil samples were collected from the field and analyzed for pH, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium levels using standard laboratory procedures. Results: The results showed that the soil pH was slightly acidic (5.5), with moderate levels of nitrogen (120 kg/ha) and phosphorus (20 kg/ha), and low levels of potassium (50 kg/ha). Discussion: The results indicate that the soil requires potassium fertilizer application to optimize maize yields. Additionally, liming may be necessary to adjust the soil pH. Conclusion: The study provides valuable information on soil fertility in the maize field, enabling informed decisions on fertilizer application and soil management practices. This technical report can be more comprehensive and detailed, depending on the project requirements.
